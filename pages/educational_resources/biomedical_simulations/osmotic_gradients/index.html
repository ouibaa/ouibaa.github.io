    <h3>Simulation of water flow due to osmotic gradient</h3>
    <p>The following p5.js sketch demonstrates a simulation of water flow due to osmotic gradients. This gradient
        occurs due to different concentrations of ions in the two fluid compartments (salmon pink and turquoise). As concentrations 
        in the two compartments change, the chemical value of 'osmolality' changes. This is calculated as the concentration of solute particles
        divided by the mass of the SOLVENT (e.g. per kg of water, rather than per kg of solution). 
    </p>
    <p>Water tends to flow against concentration gradients, effectively balancing out the osmolalities of both compartments.
        Changing the mass of water (the solvent) or the amount of ions (the solute) will change the osmolality, thereby
        affecting the direction of water flow.
    </p>
    <p>In this simulation, <b>the vertical sliders control the MASS of water (kg)</b> - this will be presented as an equivalent water line
        shown in the individual bodies of water. <b>The horizontal sliders control MOLES of ions (mol)</b>. This can be any ion, as it is the NUMBER of ions
        that matter in the formula for osmolality. Recall from high school chemistry that 1 mol is equivalent to 6.022e23 particles (Avogadro's constant).
        The final osmolality of the solution is represented by the intensity of the colour. This should be obvious.

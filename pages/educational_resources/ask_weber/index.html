        <h3>Ask Weber</h3>
        <p>Throughout 2020 (during the COVID-19 lockdowns), the University of Sydney moved to online teaching.
            To assist in this process, I was involved with the first year medical science undergraduates (MEDS1X01) by 
            answering questions they might have had regarding the lectures (as obviously they didn't have tutors during this year).
            <br>
            However, as the sessions progressed, I started writing up revision material and questions for the 'Ask Weber' seminars.
            <br>
            I cannot say how much of a success it was, but these are the slides that I had created for those tutorials.

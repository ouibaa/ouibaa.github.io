            <p>At this point, Haversine data should be imported into qGIS. Each point on the map will be a separate 
              admission data point. Each of these points will include additional attributes of 'latitude', 'longitude' and 'distance'.
              This 'distance' is the haversine distance calculated. <br />
              From here, we will represent the 'distance' value of these points by changing the colour of the underlying 'ward'. To do this:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Right click the dot layer (or the map layer), and go to properties</li>
              <li>Under symbology, change 'single symbol' to 'graduated' - this means that we will use some variable (in our case, distance) to change the symbol (that is, the colour of what you've selected).</li>
              <li>We choose the 'Value' to be the variable of interest.</li>
              <li>Add classes, then change the conditional statement for each of the symbols.</li>
              <li>Using the 'Join Attributes by Location' tool, we can transfer the dot layer data to the underlying map layer</li>
              <li>Using the 'Statistics by Categories' tool, we can statistically analyse the transferred data within the underlying map layer. This is used for ward-level analyses</li>
              <li>From here, we will be using the 'min' value - this indicates that any ward is going to be represented by the point CLOSEST TO THE HOSPITAL (!!! This will mean as long as ANY part of the ward with a patient is within a catchment radius, it will be included - this will overestimate the true size of the catchment area). Choosing max will represent the ward by the point FURTHEST AWAY FROM THE HOSPITAL. </li>
              <li>Export the newly generated statistical data as a csv file - this can be used later for analyses. Note that this data doesn't have a lat/long data, so there is no point in saving the CRS.</li>
              <li>Using the 'Join attributes by Field Value' tool, we can combine the statistical data to a fresh base-map layer - this is done to simplify/clarify data. The table fields we join are going to be GID_3 (i.e. the ward name identifier) as all data are calculated with respect to the ward names.</li>
              <li>Using symbology (as in step 2), we change the colour of the new vector map based on the value of 'min'. </li>

            <p>So far, we have our general Vietnam basemap and our heat-map on top of it. This video will cover how to change the border outline
              (that is, changing from solid borders to dotted or no borders). We also turn down the Vietnam basemap opacity, and include an OpenStreetMap (OSM)
              tile basemap. These can be quickly automated and automatically be placed in the right position as the OSM data and our own lat/long positions are using a WGS84 
              positioning reference system. <br />
              Finally, we export the data by working with the layouts. <br />
              <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/map_composer/map_composer.html">This is a very good reference from the qGIS Training Manual (latest v.3.16)</a>, which explains each and every step for how to create your own layout

            <p>In this video, we quickly go through the same steps as in the previous 5 videos to generate a map using Distance Matrix data. <br />
              The only additional things we should keep an eye on is the use of 'distance' column in our distance matrix output data. <br />

            <p>This is an example of the Distance-matrix distance map generated from HTD admissions data (2015-2016). Interestingly note how using the same distance cutoffs, there is less spread of 
              the highlighted map region when compared to the Haversine (straight line displacement) map. This is obviously because roads are not straight and radiate out from the hospital! You can use this fact to
            ensure that your generated map is somewhat valid.</p>

            <p>As above, this video quickly runs through the use of distance matrix data to calculate catchment areas. In this case, the area of concern is using 
              the 'duration' data (which may be in seconds) when calculating. In the scripts developed for this project, 'duration_in_traffic' is another column which can be used,
              and assumes a degree of traffic. <br>

            <p>This is an example of the Distance-matrix duration map generated from HTD admissions data (2015-2016). <br>
               While I didn't have time to go through this in the video, you might notice in the last few maps (this one in particular) that the 
               maps are non-continuous. There are small gaps between clearly included regions of catchment area. This is because of
              the steps we had taken in generating the data for these maps - a ward is only defined if the closest point is within the limit defined. <br>
              Well what if there is no point within the ward? Clearly, that ward will not be included then! <br> Some people may want this
               and some might not -  currently I have not investigated (nor do I have a solution) of how to overcome the non-continuous problem in qGIS. I'm sure 
              there is a way, I just haven't found it out yet. If I do figure it out, I will update this section</p>

            <p>The cumulative case ratio approach to catchment area maps is a statistical approach to the patient flow method. It was discussed with regards to catchment area determination in Uganda in Zinszer et al's 2014 paper. <br>
            The principle behind the CCR is to determine catchment area inclusion based on a region's surpassing of a threshold statistic. In this case, the region is the 'ward', and the threshold statistic is the expected occurance/admission from the ward at a population average rate (in Zinszer et al., it was if the Upper 95% CI surpassed this statistic, but we were unable to work out how this was calculated). <br>
            Another issue raised is 'how do we define the population average rate'? <br>
            This could be the rate across just Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), the rate across ALL of Vietnam (VNM), or simply the rate within wards which have at least 1 admitting patient. </p>
